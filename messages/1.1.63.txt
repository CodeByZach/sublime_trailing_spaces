    Trailing Spaces update [v1.1.63]
    -------------------------------

    Hope you've been happy gaving trailin' a hard time so far.



New feature: Keybindings
================================

With this setting, pressing "ctrl+t" will delete all
trailing spaces at once in the current file! For macOS users, use "super+t" instead.
